= User authentication

== Overview

This workshop operator targets RHPDS which include a known set of regular users: user1 to userN.

To use this workshop on other providers eg ROSA you will need a htpasswd file and some OpenShift
configuration to achieve the same user base.

You will need to be Cluster admin

Run these simple scripts to add the simple password file for 20 users

[source,bash]
----
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RedHat-EMEA-SSA-Team/workshop-operator/2.1/htpasswd/htpasswd > htpasswd
oc create secret generic htpasswd-secret --from-file=htpasswd=htpasswd -n openshift-config
oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RedHat-EMEA-SSA-Team/workshop-operator/2.1/htpasswd/oauth_htpasswd_provider -n openshift-config
----

If you want, you can build your own password file like this:

[source,bash]
----
htpasswd -c -B -b htpasswd user1 openshift
for i in {2..20} 
do
htpasswd -B -b htpasswd user$i openshift
done
